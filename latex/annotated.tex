\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_h_a_p_e___abstract__s}{SHAPE\+\_\+\+Abstract\+\_\+s}} }{\pageref{struct_s_h_a_p_e___abstract__s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_h_a_p_e___circle__s}{SHAPE\+\_\+\+Circle\+\_\+s}} \\*Mathematical representation of circles Circle are defined by their center point and radius }{\pageref{struct_s_h_a_p_e___circle__s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_h_a_p_e___ellipse__s}{SHAPE\+\_\+\+Ellipse\+\_\+s}} \\*Mathematical representation of ellipses Ellipse is closely related to a circle. The difference is that an ellipse has an x and a y radius that differs from each other }{\pageref{struct_s_h_a_p_e___ellipse__s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_h_a_p_e___line__s}{SHAPE\+\_\+\+Line\+\_\+s}} \\*Mathematical representation of lines A line is just a set of two points }{\pageref{struct_s_h_a_p_e___line__s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_h_a_p_e___path__s}{SHAPE\+\_\+\+Path\+\_\+s}} \\*Used to represent any types of shapes A path is the generic element to define a shape. All the basic shapes can be created with a path element }{\pageref{struct_s_h_a_p_e___path__s}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_h_a_p_e___rectangle__s}{SHAPE\+\_\+\+Rectangle\+\_\+s}} \\*Mathematical representation of rectangles Rectangles are defined by their position, width, and height. Rectangles may have their corners rounded }{\pageref{struct_s_h_a_p_e___rectangle__s}}{}
