## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was made as a demonstrative and visual uses of the this powerful mathematical concept that is the Fourier Series. 

The program gets the data from a SVG passed by the user, and then process it, resulting in a beautiful approximative drawing of the original SVG.

Disclaimer : The parsing module for SVG is not robust, program might crash on most of the files.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To build and run the program you will need those following packages :

```
- libxml2 
- portaudio
- gtk3 

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
